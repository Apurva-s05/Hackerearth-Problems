/*
Consider an n-element array, a, where each index i in the array contains a reference to an array of  integers Ki (where the value of Ki varies from array to array). See the Explanation section below for a diagram.

Given a, you must answer q queries. Each query is in the format i j, where i denotes an index in array a and j denotes an index in the array located at a[i] . For each query, find and print the value of element j in the array at location a[i] on a new line.


Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  (the number of variable-length arrays) and  (the number of queries).
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the -element array located at .
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (an index in array ) and  (an index in the array referenced by ) for a query.

sample input:
2 2
3 1 5 4
5 1 2 8 9 3
0 1
1 3

sample output:
5
9
